There are two dashboards which can switched between at the bottom of the tableau public viz page under metadata. The dashboards are titled Dashboard 1 and Dashboard 2.

# Dashboard 1

The first dashboard shows us what are the most popular weekdays and the average trip length per min on those days. We also have two bar charts demonstration the most popular times to start and end a trip for each hour the day. Citibike’s website has pricing for a single 30 min ride being $3 a trip and a day pass, which is for 24 hours, costs $13.15. The uptick in trip time on the weekend might be related to people being off work and having more time to take longer leisurely trips. The average duration during the business week is under 15 mins which suggest people are making more direct trips within a certain time frame during the morning or evening commute.

# Dashboard 2

On dashboard 2 we see the city map showing the popularity of station by size and color. We can tell right away that one of the most popular stations is E 17 and Broadway which located right in the middle of the city. This hub is most likely one of the most popular due to it’s location, not only is it a popular place to begin but also to end a destination. 8th Ave and W 31st also appear to be one of the top destinations which has a close proximity to the Lincoln Tunnel which could contribute to a lot of the activity in that area. The most popular stations over all seem to be located more North Central of the area leading me to believe these are the most popular areas for entertainment, shopping, and maybe even for work.
